## Heart Disease Prediction using Random Forest Classifier

This repository contains a Python script for predicting heart disease using a Random Forest Classifier. The script includes:

- Data loading from a CSV file
- Preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and encoding categorical variables
- Feature selection and target variable setup
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- Standardization of features using StandardScaler
- Model training and evaluation using a Random Forest Classifier
- Model training and evaluation using a SVM
- Model training and evaluation using a KNN
- Prediction for new patient data input

The code demonstrates a machine learning workflow for predicting heart disease based on input features and provides a classification report for model evaluation.
